  "summary": "Slider was updated to use dedicated truevolts-slider-*.jpg images with auto-rotation, arrows, dots, and English alt text. Services and Gallery sections were restyled. However, the Gallery section now references a new set of gallery images (changing the 9 image sources), and the required slider image assets were not added in the diff. The diff summary also indicates additional new landing-page features (testimonials, address/map, navbar link) that were not requested.",
